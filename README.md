# Clavo-NEAR Hackone 

This is my team project for the NEAR Hackone 2019. The purpose of this project is to utilize blockchain trustlessness credentials to protect art works.  


 ## Clavo is an online platform helps artists to protect the copyrights for artworks. It uses blockchain to provide trustlessness credential to identify an artwork is true or false.

Users can create and login their accounts, manage their home page; post artwork information and choose whether it's created by the artist or a link to the original work.
